# shop1stop

## Description

This app was created to help shoppers decide where to do their shopping if they only want to make one stop and go to one store (QFC or Safeway). Users can create multiple shopping lists, add list items to each list, select matches from each store for each list item, and see a total cost of their list at each store. Product matches are sorted by sale items first, then regular priced items, ordered by ascending price.

## Setup / Installation

This app uses:
 * React-Native front-end framework
 * Redux to interact with state  
 * react-native-router-flux for navigation
 * Firebase for user authentication and realtime database (for storing user information)

To set up this project, be sure to:
 * create a Firebase account and take the configuration information for a web app

 * use the configuration information to create your own config.js file following the configExample.js template
